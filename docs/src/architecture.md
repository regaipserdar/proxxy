# Architecture

Proxxy is built with a distributed architecture:

1. **Orchestrator**: The central brain that manages agents and stores data.
2. **Proxy Agent**: Lightweight nodes that execute the actual proxying and automation.
3. **Proxy Core**: The shared engine used by agents for traffic handling.

Detailed architecture diagrams and module breakdowns will be added here.
